### Output configuration
#
# Wallpaper, it's a symbolic link so I can easily change the wallpaper without touching here
output * bg $wallpaper fill

# You can get the names of your outputs by running: swaymsg -t get_outputs

### Idle configuration

exec swayidle -w \
    timeout 300 'swaylock -f -i $wallpaper' \
    timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * power off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * power on"' \

# This will lock your screen after 300 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.

### Input configuration

# Set the layout to US-international QWERTY with dead letters so I can write
# for example ñ (altgr + n) and € (altgr + 5).
# Use altgr-intl instead of intl so I can write paths without problems (in
# intl, ~ waits for a second key press so you need to type ~ twice to insert
# the character).
# the character).
# If you want to see all of the layouts you can use the following commands:
# List all layouts -> localectl list-x11-keymap-layouts
# List all variants of US -> localectl list-x11-keymap-variants us
input * {
    xkb_layout "us"
    xkb_variant "altgr-intl"
}

#
# You can get the names of your inputs by running: swaymsg -t get_inputs

    # Screenshots
    # Note: Some editors don't work well with : in links (for example, Obsidian
    #       doesn't include the file and fails silently). ISO 8601 (ex: date -Is) prints
    #       the time separated with :. As I never check the date of a screenshot and what
    #       I truly want is to be able to sort them I started using the UNIX Epoch.
    #       Nobody can read that, but hey, you got it sorted :P
